/*

* What events will I use?

*1) Focus on the `button`
    - How to `switch` the active button?
    - Make a function that does that and invoke from REPL.
    -Can you wire that up to a `click` listener?
    -There are 2 buttons.
*2) What caused the layout to shift when buttons are clicked?
    (find reference to this?)
    - Write a function to do that?
    - Wire it up to a `click` event.
    -Can you toggle between them?
